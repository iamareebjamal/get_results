    AMU B.Tech Results Downloader
    This Python script downloads B.Tech Results of whole class based on information in attendance Excel file.

    First you need to put Excel file in Input/ folder
    Then type the name of file when asked (Default : store.xlsx)
    This will load the information about students from the Excel file and stores it in students.db for future faster access.
    Then you will prompted 3 options:

        First option downloads the result of whole class and
        stores them as html pages in Store/ folder.
        Note : This option should be run at least once to
        download  all necessary result files for further options
        If there are no result files in Store/ folder, then
        script will not run properly.

        Second option loads CPI and SPI from downloaded
        html to script database as results.db for future faster
        access.
        Note : This option is necessary to be run in
        order to run 3rd option. If this option is not run,
        then no data can be written in Excel file.

        Third option reads your CPI and SPI from Updated
        database and saves the information as Excel file in
        Output/ folder.


    Note: App creates required files and databases in iaj/ folder for proper functioning. Please don't delete those files.
